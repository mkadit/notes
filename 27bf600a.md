# Introduction to Databases

## Introduction

### Definition

A Collection of related data whose facts can be recorded and has implicit meaning

### Properties

- A database can be considered as a _miniworld_ or a _Universe of Discourse_ (UoD) as it can represent some, but not all, aspect of the world
- Logically coherent collection of data with inherent meaning, meaning that the collection of data can be used but does not exist to elicit any meaning
- A database is build for specific purpose, such as to contains general informations of students

### Database Management System (DBMS)

DBMS is a collection of programs designed to define, manipulate, retrieve, and manage data in a database. With it a user can create, and maintain a database as the users wishes

#### Example

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- MongoDB
- etc

### Database System

#### How it Works

1. Application program accessed the database by sending commands or queries
2. The DBMS Software processed the query
3. The Software then accessed the Meta-Data and the Stored Database
   - Meta-Data is the description of data about a particular data
   - Data is the actual data, with words, facts, measurements, etc

### Examples of Database Application

- Traditional Database Application
  Stores **textual** or **numeric** informations (Spreadsheets)
- Multimedia Databases
  Store **images**, **audio**, **clips**, and **video** streams digitally (Youtube?)
- Geographic information Systems (GIS)
  Store and analyze **maps**, **weather data**, and **satellite images** (Google maps)
- Data Warehouses and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) Systems
  Extract and analyze useful business information from **very large databases** to support **decision making**
- Real-time and Active Database Technology
  Using real-time processing to handle workloads whose states are **constantly changing** (Waze)

### Defining a Database

Specify the **data types**, **structures**, and **constraints** of the data stored. The data would be stored as a meta-data, which would be stored in the form of a **dictionary**

### Terms

- Manipulating a database

  - Query and update database
  - Generate reports

- Sharing a database

  - Allow multiple users and programs to access the database simultaneously

- Application Program

  - Abscesses database by sending queries to DBMS

- Query

  - Data retrieval

- Transaction

  - May some data to be read or written on the database

- Protection includes

  - System protection
  - Security protection

- Maintain the database System

  - Allow the system to evolve as requirements change over time
