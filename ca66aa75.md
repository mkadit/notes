## What is Design Pattern

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each problems have their solution, creating a problem and solution pair with each problems having their own templates/blueprints.

### Vs Algorithm

Design patterns would sometimes be confused with algorithms as both provides solutions to typical problems. An easy way to diffrinitiate between the two would be that a design pattern is more like a _blueprint_, as in you know the features and results, while an algorithm is it's _inner working_, as in how you implement them.

### Elements of Design Pattern

- Name : Describes the pattern, adding common terminology for facilitating communication
- Problem: Describes _when_ to apply the pattern and what it is trying to solve
- Solution: Describe the **content**, the elements, relationsips, responsibilities, and their collaborations
- Consequences: Describe the **trade offs**, what do we get, what do we paid for it, the pros and cons

### Classification

Design pattern can be classified as:

- [Creational](lesson/adpro/Creational-DP)
- [Structural](lesson/adpro/Structural-DP)
- [Behavioural](lesson/adpro/Behavioural-DP)

## Possible Used Concepts

### Encapsulation (Information Hiding)

Encapsulation is used to **prevent manipulation** of exposed fields from **outside** by **hiding** them and permitting only stylized access to the object, as it can lead to unwanted or the inability to change

### Subclassing (Inheritance)

Subclassing is used to stop the massive headache when maintaining code for abstractions that has **similar members (field and methods)** by inheriting default members from a super class

### Iteration

Iteration is used to create a **standard interface** to communicate when wishing to access all members, **preventing perfoming specialised traversal for each data structure**

### Exception

Exception is used when your code is cluttered with **error-handling code**

## Why Design Pattern

- Design pattern can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms
- It can help you prevent messy codes as reusing design patterns help improving code readability
- Design pattern can make maintaining, extending, scaling, testing, or reusing your code easier

### Pros

- Add **consistency** to designs by solving similar problems the same way, independent of language
- Add **clarity** to design and design communication by enabling
  a common vocabulary
- Improve **time** to solution by providing template which serve as foundations for good design
- Improve **reuse** through composition

### Cons

- Some patterns come with negative consequences
  - Object proliferation, performance hits, additional layers
- Consequences are subjective & depend on concrete scenarios
- Patterns subject to different interpretations, misinterpretations, and philosophies
- Patterns can be overused and abused â†’ Anti-Patterns
