## Definition

Ability that allows application programs **not being affected by changes** in irrelevant parts of the conceptual data representation, data storage structure and data access methods

Basically as long as the parts are above the changed schema, it won't go transformer.

## Characteristics

- **Invisibility** (transparency) of the details of entire database organization, storage structure, and access strategy to the users
- Both logical and physical

### Relation to Software Engineering Concepts

- **Abstraction** the details of an application's components can be hidden, providing a broad perspective on the design
  âž”
- **Representation independence**: changes can be made to the implementation that have no impact on the interface and its users

## Types of Data Independence

### Logical Data Independence

The capacity to change the conceptual schema without having to change the external schemas and their application programs

#### Picture of Logical Data Independence

Because the external schema is above the line, there won't be changes to the external schema unlike the others

### Physical Data Independence

The capacity to change the internal schema without having to change the conceptual schema and the external schema

Because only the internal schema under the line, only the internal schema be changed
